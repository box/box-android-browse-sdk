Box Android Browse SDK
==============
This SDK enables the ability to easily browse through Box storage to pick a folder/file.

Developer Setup
--------------
The SDK can be obtained by adding it as a maven dependency, cloning the source into your project, or by downloading one of the precompiled JARs from the releases page on GitHub.

Gradle: 
```groovy 
compile 'com.box:box-android-browse-sdk:2.0.0'
```
Maven: 
```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.box</groupId>
    <artifactId>box-android-browse-sdk</artifactId>
    <version>2.0.0</version>
</dependency>
```

If not using Gradle or Maven, this SDK has the following dependencies and will need to be included in your project:
* [box-android-sdk](https://github.com/box/box-android-sdk) (maven: `com.box:box-android-sdk:3.0.2`)

Quickstart
--------------
You will need a BoxSession and the BoxItem from the [box-content-sdk](https://github.com/box/box-android-content-sdk). Please refer to the documentation of the box-content-sdk for additional details.
```java
    BoxSession session = new BoxSession(MainActivity.this);
    BoxFolder folder = new BoxApiFolder(session).getInfo("<FOLDER_ID>").send();
```
####File Picker
To launch the activity to browse a given folder and pick a file:
```java
    startActivityForResult(BoxBrowseFileActivity.getLaunchIntent(MainActivity.this, "<FOLDER_ID>", session), "<YOUR_REQUEST_CODE>");
```

To receive the result from the file picker after you picked a file, implement onActivityResult in your activity:
```java
    @Override
    protected void onActivityResult(int requestCode, int resultCode, Intent data) {
        if (requestCode ==  "<YOUR_REQUEST_CODE>") {
            if (resultCode == Activity.RESULT_OK) {
                BoxFile boxFile = (BoxFile) data.getSerializableExtra(FilePickerActivity.EXTRA_BOX_FILE);
                // Your own code to handle boxFile goes here.
            } else {
                // Your error handling code.
            }
        }
    }
```

####Folder Picker
To launch the activity to browse a given folder and pick a folder:
```java
    startActivityForResult(BoxBrowseFolderActivity.getLaunchIntent(MainActivity.this, "<FOLDER_ID>", session),  "<YOUR_REQUEST_CODE>");
```

To receive the result from the file picker after you picked a folder, implement onActivityResult in your activity:
```java
    @Override
    protected void onActivityResult(int requestCode, int resultCode, Intent data) {
        if (requestCode ==  "<YOUR_REQUEST_CODE>") {
            if (resultCode == Activity.RESULT_OK) {
                BoxFolder boxFolder = (BoxFolder) data.getSerializableExtra(FolderPickerActivity.EXTRA_BOX_FOLDER);
                // Your own code to handle boxFile goes here.
            } else {
                // Your error handling code.
            }
        }
    }
```

####Manifest
Please add the following to your manifest file:
```xml
	<activity
        android:name="com.box.androidsdk.content.auth.OAuthActivity"
        android:label="Authentication" >
    </activity>
```
